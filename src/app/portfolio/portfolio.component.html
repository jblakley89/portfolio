            <h2>Github</h2>
            <p>I have made a few minor contributions to open source projects and have been actively involved in InnerSource within companies. Here are a few of my more notable projects.
            <p>
              <b>This website</b>
              <br />
              <a href="https://github.com/jblakley89/portfolio">https://github.com/jblakley89/portfolio</a>
              <br />
              This website has evolved over the years, starting first in php, and continuing to be rewritten as I needed to learn or expand upon my skills. Currently it is written in Angular.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>NGRX Unit Testing</b>&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/jblakley89/ngrx-unittest">https://github.com/jblakley89/ngrx-unittest</a>
              <br />
              This is a quick website using an open api for a real working example of how to use ngrx. It also demonstrates how to write unit tests around both your reducer and effects.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Dotfiles</b>&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/jblakley89/dotfiles">https://github.com/jblakley89/dotfiles</a>
              <br />
              This isn't a programming project, but a portable *nix environment that I can intantly deploy on any system I need to use. It will automatically install and configure zsh, tmux, my vim programming environment, and a few useful utilities.
            </p>
